## Installation

### Building Locally 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyncStream-Org/SyncStream.git
   cd SyncStream
   ```
   
2. Checkout a tagged version:
   ```bash
   git checkout tags/<tag_name>
   ```

3. Configure the .env file as described [/docs/ADMIN.md](./docs/ADMIN.md). 

4. Start the server and client using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

### Using Docker

1. Download the Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yaml in the root directory)

2. Configure the .env file as described [/docs/ADMIN.md](./docs/ADMIN.md). Be sure to specify the name of the image to be pulled in the .env file from [Packages](https://github.com/SyncStream-Org/SyncStream/pkgs/container/sync-stream)

3. Start the server using Docker Compose
   ```bash
   docker compose up --pull
   ```
The server runs on `http://localhost:80` by default. It is encouraged to place the server behind a proxy. Make note of the version used in the server (either from the package version or the tag version), and direct members of your organization to download a corresponding client build on the [Releases page](https://github.com/SyncStream-Org/SyncStream/releases). See [/docs/ADMIN.md](./docs/ADMIN.md) for additional documentation for administrating a SyncStream server.
