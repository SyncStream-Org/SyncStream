# Admin Documentation

This file documents how to configure a SyncStream server instance and how to create accounts for users.

## Environment Configuration

The following environment variables are required for configuring the SyncStream server:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Password for the PostgreSQL database user |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Username for the PostgreSQL database |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Name of the PostgreSQL database |
| `DOCKER_IMAGE_BACKEND` | Docker image name for the backend service |
| `ADMIN_USER` | Username for the initial admin account |
| `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for the initial admin account |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Email address for the initial admin account |

A template configuration can be found in [env-template](../.env-template).

## Account Creation

The server URL is required to connect clients to the SyncStream client. Use this as well as the account information (configured in the .env file) to login into the SyncStream client. From here, navigate to the admin panel. Within the admin panel, users can be created by filling out the needed information, note that the display name is optional. Once successfully created, an autogenerated password will appear, make note of this. Communicate the server URL, as well with respective usernames and autogenerated passwords to the members in your organization.
